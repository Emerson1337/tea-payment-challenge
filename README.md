# TeaPayment - Challenge

Some ideas to build in challenge:

To build it we’ll use Typescript, ReactJS, Axios and Styled Components. We’ll have SCSS files for context styles. We also gonna use react icons, react-router-dom, eslint and prettier.

- [x] Two main components (cities buttons and weather cards)
- [x] Routes Lib by API (clean architecture)
- [x] Path mapping (clean code)
- [x] Input to search user preferences city
  - [x] History search by local storage (Your history)
    - [x] Clear history
- [x] Prettier and ESLint
